# 📊 Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset using Python.  

The main objective was to understand how students performed across different subjects and analyze whether study hours had an impact on total scores.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- Student Name  
- Gender  
- Math Score  
- Science Score  
- English Score  
- Study Hours  
- TotalScore (calculated as the sum of all subject scores)

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Students who studied more hours generally scored higher total marks.
- Math had the widest variation in scores compared to other subjects.
- Student **H** achieved the highest overall total score.
- Most students studied between 1 to 3 hours.

## 📊 Visualizations Created
To better understand the data, I created:
- A bar chart to compare total scores of each student  
- A histogram to analyze the distribution of study hours  
- A boxplot to compare subject-wise performance

## 🚀 What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib  
- Interpreting statistical summaries  
- Drawing meaningful insights from small datasets
